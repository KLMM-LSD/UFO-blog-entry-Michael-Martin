## Monitoring
**Overview**
```
state the problem 
say why it is interesting 
say what your solution achieves 
say what follows from your solution
```
```
The first states the problem. 
The second states why the problem is a problem. 
The third is my startling sentence. 
The fourth states the implication of my startling sentence.

**Abstract 1**
```
Monitoring of Large Systems is widely used in system production process by large businesses. 
With the computer network technology, system testing, system integration, 
operational performance and Detection of failures, 
monitoring of a large System under development is present.
Based on it, the signal processing approach of a large system under complex circumstances is proposed, 
and the software of a monitoring system for a Large System is developed.
Through a monitoring system that has been used in our project, 
key parameters and elements can be found by exposing the systems methods and classes, also called targets, 
and making them into metrics. This system can accurately analyze and locate critical faults in the system, 
reduce faults rate, extend service life on this system and increase performance and productivity of the large system.

**Kent Beck Abstract**
```
- Being able of monitoring large systems is an important part when developing large systems undergoing constant development and changes
- Constant monitoring will avoid too much downtime on the system and can help with performance
- By using various tools and services we are able to use Prometheus/Grafana in our development process
- this practice of monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana, once made and deployed can be used again with changes if needed.
