### Monitoring 1 

Abstract
```
	We've all worked on some complex software before and ran into problems.
	Sometimes these problems were an easy fix, other times it drove us mad.
	Whether its a bug in your system, a performance issues or something third,
	it's good to be able to identify the problem fast, rather than having to
	hours finding out what is wrong. To solve this issue we suggest a method of 
	Monitoring that allows us to automatically monitor our code. By utilizing
	serveal of the tools mentioned in this article, it becomes easier to monitor 
	various areas of your software.Through an alarm system, it will be possible to 
        be notified about a potential issue, before anyone else realizes it. 
	Correct monitoring automates everything and saves time for both customer 
	and developer.
