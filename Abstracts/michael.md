**Abstract 1**
```
Monitoring of Large Systems is widely used in system production process by large businesses. 
With the computer network technology, system testing, system integration, 
operational performance and Detection of failures, 
monitoring of a large System under development is present.
Based on it, the signal processing approach of a large system under complex circumstances is proposed, 
and the software of a monitoring system for a Large System is developed.
Through a monitoring system that has been used in our project, 
key parameters and elements can be found by exposing the systems methods and classes, also called targets, 
and making them into metrics. This system can accurately analyze and locate critical faults in the system, 
reduce faults rate, extend service life on this system and increase performance and productivity of the large system.
